\section{Exercise 1}
Our code for Minimax relies on the pseudo code from the lecture "Artificial Intelligence" by Prof. Lakemeyer.\\ We do not work on a tree structure but use recursion. The function takes the cut-off depth, the current depth and a map state as arguments.\\
The termination condition is whether the current depth is equal to the cut-off depth. Then we return the heuristic value.\\
If we have not reached the cut-off depth yet, we first check whether the current player can make a move and otherwise we call the function for the next player. If the current player can make a move, we recursively calculate the Minimax values for every possible successor map. If the current player is us, then we return the best of the resulting values and otherwise the worst.\\
On the first level, we remember the move that belongs to the best seen Minimax value of a successor state and finally we return this move.
