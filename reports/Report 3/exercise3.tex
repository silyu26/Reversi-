\section{Exercise 3}
\subsection{Discussions}
The third task deals with benchmarks. For this assignment we wanted to create a basic foundation for our benchmark strategy and use it to test and compare Minimax and AlphaBeta. 
\subsection{Solutions}
To benchmark our programm, we use \textit{System.currentTimeMillis()}. To measure the time methods take in our programm, we just calculate the distance between the time before and after the method call. Some results of this regarding MiniMax and AlphaBeta will be presented in our group-meeting.\\
Future benchmarks will require to test different parts of methods. We will use the same benchmark technique as for simple method calls. This requires making clones of our methods, but gives us the chance to benchmark most parts of our code easily.\\
The data obtained when benchmarking is written in a CSV-file and then plotted with "datplot" by Michael Vogt. This gives us the chance to write all obtained data of one benchmark in a file and plot by different values later.
