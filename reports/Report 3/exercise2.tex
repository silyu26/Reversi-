\section{Exercise 2}
Our code for Alpha-Beta Pruning relies on the pseudo code from the lecture "Artificial Intelligence" by Prof. Lakemeyer. We do not work on a tree structure but use recursion.\\
We did one modification for the first level of the search tree. The pseudo code suggests to calculate the alpha-value for the root and then return the action that has this value as its own alpha-value. However, our methods for calculating alpha and beta only return the value and no corresponding move.\\
Modifying it to return both seemed unnecessary as we only need the move for level 1. Therefore, we calculate level 1 in an own method and remember the move that belongs to the best alpha-value seen.\\
We also changed our code such that there can be several enemy players by checking whether we first player is us (then we calculate the alpha-value for the next level) or someone else (then we calculate the beta-value).
