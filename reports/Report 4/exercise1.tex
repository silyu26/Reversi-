\section{Exercise 1}
Our implemtatio of the move finding algorithms works with a method called \textbf{moveEnumeration()} which returns an ArrayList of all possible moves. We wrote another function that sorts these moves according to the rating of the board they lead too. We did this by writing a basic Comparator and use it with Collections.Sort(), which is some mergesort implementation. This improved our calculations quite well as you can see in our benchmarking results part.
