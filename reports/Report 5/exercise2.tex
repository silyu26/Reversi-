\section{Task 2}
The second task of the assignment dealt with implementing the aspiration window algorithm. We save the alpha and beta values from the last evaluations and use those as our guess for the next alpha/beta values. Then a window is added. We found a good having versions of our own Ai play with different winddowsizes against eachother.
