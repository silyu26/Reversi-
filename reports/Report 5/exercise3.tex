We found n optimal windwow size by letting Versions of our Ai with different window sizes play against eachother. Minimizing the times the calculation needed to restart lead to windows that were too big. We decided to settle for a window size of 5, this way about every Xth calculation is restarted. We noticed that the mapsize heavily influences the goodness of our windowsize. Therefore we plan to make a dynaic windowsize depending on the mapsize or the in relation to the last evaluation of the board. This would most definitely be an optimisation to our current aolution, but it heavily depends on the heuristic we use. Next week our focus will be on reworking our heuristic because of the lack of performance from our AI, the windowsize will be optmised again fitting the new heuristic.
